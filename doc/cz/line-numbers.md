# Line Numbers for the Czech Republic

Line numbers are derived from those used by SŽDC’s in their network
statement. See [Numbering of lines according to Network Statement](http://provoz.szdc.cz/PORTAL/Show.aspx?path=/Data/Mapy/cisla_PD.pdf)
a map of these. Like the map, we are using the first three digits only.

However, unlike official Czech lines we follow stationing, so we nee do
make adjustments. We also means that line numbers used currently are
preliminary and may change later.
