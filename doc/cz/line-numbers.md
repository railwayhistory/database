# Line Numbers for the Czech Republic

Line numbers are derived from those used by SŽDC’s in their network
statement. See [Numbering of lines according to Network Statement](http://provoz.szdc.cz/PORTAL/Show.aspx?path=/Data/Mapy/cisla_PD.pdf)
a map of these. Like the map, we are using the first three digits only.
