# Line Numbers for Poland

Lines are primarily numbered according to “Instrukcję Id – 12 (D-29) - Wykaz
linii” as published by PKP Polskie Linie Kolejowe. The current text as of
29 December 2017 is available from [PLK](https://www.plk-sa.pl/files/public/user_upload/pdf/Akty_prawne_i_przepisy/Instrukcje/Wydruk/Id-12__D29__Wykaz_linii_-_XIIa_2017.pdf).

Additional numbers for lines not part of the document are given provisonal
numbers as they are encountered. The numbers are simply given consecutive
numbers but are grouped per voivodeship of the start of the line. Each group
starts with the motor vehicle license plate code of the voivodeship followed
by two digits for the line number.

For a list of license plate codes, see [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voivodeships_of_Poland#List_of_voivodeships).
