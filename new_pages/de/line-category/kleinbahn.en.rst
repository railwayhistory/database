Tertiary Railway in Germany
===========================

After the main railway network was established during the second
half of the 19th century, there were still large areas that had no
railway line. These were mostly sparsely populated areas with low
demand where it was near impossibly to run a profitable railway
operation. In order to boost development of these areas, many
German states implemented the category of tertiary railways with
very relaxed requirements on construction and operation in order to
improve the economics for railways in such areas.

This was especially fruitful in the state of Prussia, which introduced
the category as *Kleinbahn* (literally: petty railway). Over the years
a wide network of such railways developed sponsored by communities,
counties and private entrepreneurs. In other states, these railways had
different names: *Provinzialbahn,*  *Lokalbahn,* etc.

After World War II, with the spread of the automobile, many of
these railways lost their purpose and have since been closed down.
In East Germany, they were nationalised and merged into the
state railway. In West Germany, most states have since abandoned
the category. The few lines that are left are now operated as
secondary railways. The only exception is the state of Berlin,
where the category still exists.
