Station Tracks in Germany
=========================

Regulation for the operation of railways usually distinguishes
between operation within and outside of station limit. The main
difference usually is that inside of stations shunting is allowed,
ie., moving vehicles at low speed without strict measures of protection
from collisions. In other words, within the
station limits, movement of vehicles can be done without expensive
technical equipment.

During the demise of the railway, many lines have lost passenger
services and have only been kept open to allow freight traffic to
some factories along the line. Often this meant one service a day
or even a week. In some cases, these services have been simplified
by including the railway line into the limits of a station. The
German terms for this are *Bahnhofsgleis* (station track) or
*Streckenrangiergleis* (lit. line shunting track).
