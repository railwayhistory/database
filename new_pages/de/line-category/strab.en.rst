Tram Lines in Germany
=====================

Trams are governed by a separate regulation, the
*Verordnung über den Bau und Betrieb der Straßenbahnen*
(Regulation of construction and operation of tramways), mainly
because of the different for rail vehicles operating in a
shared environment with road vehicles.

Besides actual tram lines, this category contains underground
lines, monorails, and similar railways but not mountain railways,
cable cars, funiculars and such. Tram lines do not exclusively
exist in cities. Some networks in rural areas have been put into
this category to benefit from the easier operational regime.
