Industrial Railway in Germany
=============================

Various railway lines or spurs have been built without the
intention to for public service. They are usually owned by a
industrial cooperation such as a mining company and are only used
for internal transportation of freight and, in some cases,
employees. Such railways are usually categorized under
*Anschlussbahn* (lit. connection railway), since most of them are a
mere track connecting a factory yard with a nearby railway line.
Despite that, there are wide networks of such railways, such as the
railways of the open-pit coal mining operations.
