:title: The 'category' Line Event Attribute

The *category* Line Event Attribute
===================================

The category of a line describes its legal status, if such a distinction
exists in the relevant jurisdiction. An often found example of line
categories is the distinction between main lines and branch lines.

The value of the ~category~ line attribute is an
:ref:`~base.enum`. For possible values, see below.
Since categories strongly depend on the country in question, values are
always prefixed with the country code.
