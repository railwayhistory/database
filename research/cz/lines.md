# Line Numbers in the Czech Republic

Cursory research has not produced any offically used system of line numbers.
Lines seem to be widely referenced by the numbers used in the official
timetable. A complete list of these can be found in [Czech Wikipedia].
However, these lines do not always follow posted mileage and therefore are
not always useful.

For the time being, we will be using a system of four digit line numbers.
For lines or sections appearing in the official timetable, the first three
digits will be equal to the number of the line or the most significant
section as used by the official timetable. The last digit is used to
distinguish lines where necessary.

This system is preliminary and may be replaced later.
